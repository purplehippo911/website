This is my very own website, where I show off what I've done and talk a bit about my coding journey.

18.08.22 - Minor update
- added `sunnySide`-site to portfolio
- deleted assets and called it dist instead


30.07.22 - Major update
- added `assets` and `src`-folders for js, css and images
- used gulp to compile and minimize the size of media stuff like js, css and images. Which means my website is now a bit faster.🚀 
- a more responsive navbar, when the screen shrinks to something around 600px.
- added logo, so that it's visible next to the webpage title.
- added more screenshots to `README.md`

- added more images to the `images`-folder
- made html more semantic
- finished the gallery

23.07.22 - Major update
- made the `screenshots`-folder and divided the images to their place.
- started on `gallery.html` 


22.07.22 - Major update
- just started with the landing page
- added `app.js`-file, for my greeting section

- took some screenshots of the page
