            <p>
              I remember that I always have had a passion for technology when I
              was younger. I was just facinated by it. And in 2019, or something
              I started with learning the basics of python. Then I went over to
              learning HTML and CSS, and at the same time falling in love with
              frontend. It was of course difficult in the start, and I gave up
              multiple times on the way. But some months later, am I making a
              website as an intermediate frontend coder.

              I dunno. I also like to read novels and comics, take photos of
              nature, cook some food, play on my nintendo switch games like sky
              and stuff like that and watch youtbe shorts or netflix series
              called dark.

              Well, you can check out my projects, by clicking on `portfolio` on
              the navigation. Yeah, I know I mention it all the time in my
              projects, but the best way I can improve is by continously getting
              some feedbacküëç
